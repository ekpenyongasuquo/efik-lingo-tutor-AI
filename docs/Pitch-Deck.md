Revised 15-Slide Pitch Deck
Slide 1 — The Hook
Project Title: Efik STEM Tutor: Bridging the Linguistic Divide in Science
Presenter: Ekpenyong Mfon | Institution: Ensign College
Competition: Microsoft Imagine Cup 2026/2027
Tagline: Empowering the next generation of African scientists in their mother tongue.
Slide 2 — The Language Barrier
The Hidden Cost of "English-Only" Learning
The Problem: Over 60% of Nigerian students learn STEM in a non-native language.
The Result: STEM failure rates skyrocket because students are fighting a "language war" instead of learning science.
The Insight: Language should be a vehicle for knowledge, not a barrier to it.
Slide 3 — The Core Problem: Cognitive Overload
The Double Burden of decoding
Students must decode complex English syntax and abstract scientific concepts simultaneously.
This "Cognitive Overload" kills curiosity and causes early disengagement from tech careers.
The Opportunity: Remove the language friction to unlock latent scientific potential.
Slide 4 — Our Solution: The Efik STEM Tutor
A Localized AI for a Global Future
An Intelligent Tutor grounded in a 22,939-row professional Efik STEM dataset.
Built to respect the cultural and mathematical logic of the Efik people.
Impact: Science is no longer "foreign"; it becomes observable and personal.
Slide 5 — Architecture: The Reasoning Engine
Powered by Azure & GPT-4o
Utilizes GPT-4o as a high-performance reasoning engine.
The Constraint: This is not a "free-chat" bot. It is a Guided Agent restricted to verified scientific parameters.
The Advantage: High intelligence with zero deviation from STEM facts.
Slide 6 — Architecture: The Grounding Layer
Eliminating Hallucinations via System-Level RAG
Architecture: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) through system-level prompt grounding.
The Guardrail: Forced use of approved Efik STEM vocabulary from our curated CSV.
Reliability: The AI cannot "invent" terminology; it must use the verified professional corpus.
Slide 7 — Linguistic Innovation: Scientific Primitives
Beyond Translation: Interpretation
We have developed Efik "primitives" for modern STEM concepts:
Atom: Atọm (The indivisible ekpri n̄kpọ)
Energy: Odudu
Cell: Ekpri ubet uwem (The building block of life)
The "Emi" Rule: Using immediate language (emi) to make science feel present and real.
Slide 8 — Mathematical Innovation: Vigesimal Logic
Respecting the Base-20 System
Efik math is naturally Vigesimal (Base-20).
Our AI calculates using indigenous logic:
$20 = Edịp$ | $40 = Aba$ | $100 = Ikie$
Equation Example: $Edịp (20) X times Ita (3) = Ata (60)$.
We use "Cassava Math" to teach multiplication (Awak) and division (Bahade).
Slide 9 — Biology & Chemistry Modules
The Farm is the Laboratory
Photosynthesis: Explained via cassava farming and solar energy (Un̄wana utịn).
States of Matter (N̄kpọ ekededi emi ọyọhọde ebiet):
Solid: Itiat (Stone)
Liquid: Mmọn̄ akpa (River water)
Gas: IMmọn̄ emi etiere nte ofụm (Steam/Vapor)
Slide 10 — Physics & Engineering
Demystifying the Physical World
Gravity: Defined as Odudu emi esidụri n̄kpọ (The force that pulls things).
Engineering: Simple machines taught through farm tools and levers used in rural construction.
Outcome: Students see Physics in their daily chores and harvests.
Slide 11 — Technical Roadmap
Scaling on the Microsoft Stack
MVP: Azure AI Foundry Playground (Validated).
Alpha: Backend deployment via Azure Functions and Azure AI Search.
Production: Full Web App deployment on Azure App Service.
Efficiency: Highly optimized tokens ($<800$ per request).
Slide 12 — Social Impact: The "Inclusion" Metric
Measuring Success Beyond Code
Goal: 30% reduction in early STEM failure in pilot Efik-speaking schools.
Confidence: Building "Scientific Self-Efficacy" in rural students.
Pathways: Moving students from rural farms to global tech pipelines.
Slide 13 — Scalability: The African Blueprint
One Framework, Many Tongues
The "Linguistic Grounding Model" we built for Efik is a template.
Future Reach: Can be scaled to Igbo, Hausa, Yoruba, and Swahili.
Vision: A pan-African AI that preserves indigenous languages while teaching global science.
Slide 14 — Project Timeline
The Road to Graduation (October 2026)
Q1 2026: Core Dataset Grounding & Logic Verification (Complete).
Q2 2026: Beta Testing with Ensign College peer groups.
Q3 2026: Azure App Service Deployment & Pilot Launch in Calabar.
Oct 2026: Final Presentation & Graduation.
Slide 15 — The Vision
“Science in our tongue, progress for our people.”
Preserving cultural heritage through modern technology.
The Mission: To ensure no African student is "left behind" because of the language they were born speaking.
Call to Action: Let's build a future where every child can dream in their own language.
